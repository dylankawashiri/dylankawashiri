## About Me
I am a highly motivated graduating physics major with a research interest in quantum information sciences with an emphasis on atomic, molecular, and optical physics. I have extensive knowledge of quantum optics, atomic physics, programming, physics simulations, electronics, and more which I have demonstrated in laboratory settings under Professor Susumu Takahashi at USC and Professor Eric Hudson at UCLA. I am eager to continue applying my skills and knowledge and hope I can help advance the field while learning all that I can.
